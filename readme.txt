## TSCHORA_results_utils.run_grid_search function 

The provided code is a Python script that performs a grid search operation for hyperparameter 
tuning of a machine learning model. 
The main function [`run_grid_search`]
takes several parameters including the name of the model, the dataset to be used,
the country for which the model is being trained, and several other parameters
related to the grid search operation.

The function starts by creating an instance of [`MySplitter`]
class, which is used to split the dataset into training and validation (for hyperparameter optimization) sets.
The [`MySplitter`] class takes a validation ratio and a boolean indicating whether
to shuffle the data or not. It provides a [`get_splitter`] method that creates a predefined split 
of the data based on the validation ratio and the shuffle flag.

Next, the [`create_mw`]
function is called to create a model wrapper.
This function takes several parameters including the country, dataset, model, and name, 
and returns a model wrapper. The model wrapper is an object that encapsulates the model 
and provides methods for loading the training dataset, getting the search space for hyperparameters,
and saving the results of the grid search.

The [`get_search_space`]
function is then called to get the search space for the hyperparameters. 
This function takes several parameters including the model wrapper, the number of data points, 
the country, and several other parameters related to the grid search. 
It returns a search space which is a dictionary where the keys are the names of the hyperparameters 
and the values are the ranges of values that each hyperparameter can take.

The [`set_all_seeds`] 
function is called to set the seed for the random number generator. 
This is done to ensure that the random sampling of the hyperparameters is reproducible.

The [`get_param_list_and_seeds`]
function is then called to get a list of parameter combinations
to be tested and a list of seeds for the random number generator. 
This function takes several parameters including the search space, 
the number of combinations to be tested, the country, and the model wrapper. 
It returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a combination of hyperparameters 
to be tested, and a list of seeds for the random number generator.

The [`parallelize`] 
function is then called to perform the grid search in parallel. 
This function takes several parameters including the number of CPUs to be used, the model wrapper, 
the list of parameter combinations, the training data, and several other parameters related 
to the grid search. It returns a list of results where each result is a tuple containing the mean 
absolute error and the training time for a particular combination of hyperparameters.

The [`results_to_df`] 
function is then called to convert the results of the grid search into a pandas DataFrame. 
This function takes several parameters including the results, the list of parameter combinations, 
the list of seeds, and several other parameters. It returns a DataFrame where each row 
represents a combination of hyperparameters and the corresponding mean absolute error and training time.

Finally, the results are saved to a CSV file and the model wrapper is returned.

## parralel_scikit.parallelize

The provided Python function [`parallelize`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22work%2Fparallel_scikit.py%22%2C%22parallelize%22%5D "work/parallel_scikit.py") is designed to perform parallelized model training and validation using different sets of parameters. This function is particularly useful when you want to perform hyperparameter tuning on a machine learning model, and you want to speed up the process by utilizing multiple CPUs.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. The function takes several arguments:
   - [`n_cpus`]: the number of CPUs to use for parallelization.
   - [`model`]: the machine learning model to train.
   - [`param_list`]: a list of different sets of parameters to use for training the model.
   - [`X`] and [`y`]: the training data and corresponding labels.
   - [`seeds`]: optional, a list of seeds for random number generators.
   - [`validation_mode`]: optional, the mode of validation to use ("external" by default).
   - [`external_spliter`]: optional, an external data splitter.

2. The function first calculates the number of different parameter combinations ([`n_combis`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22work%2Fparallel_scikit.py%22%2C%22n_combis%22%5D "work/parallel_scikit.py")) by getting the length of [`param_list`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22work%2Fparallel_scikit.py%22%2C%22param_list%22%5D "work/parallel_scikit.py") using the [`len`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.2.2%2Fdist%2Ftypeshed-fallback%2Fstdlib%2Fbuiltins.pyi%22%2C%22len%22%5D "../../../../../../../../.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-pylance-2024.2.2/dist/typeshed-fallback/stdlib/builtins.pyi") function.

3. It then splits the data into training and validation sets using the [`outer_validation`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22work%2Fparallel_scikit.py%22%2C%22outer_validation%22%5D "work/parallel_scikit.py") function. The mode of validation and the external splitter are passed as arguments to this function.

4. The function then uses the [`Parallel`]
 and [`delayed`] functions from the `joblib` library to parallelize the model 
 training and validation process. 
 The [`Parallel`] function creates a parallel computing environment with [`n_cpus`]
number of CPUs. The [`delayed`] function is used to specify the function to be parallelized 
[`to_parallelize`], along with its arguments. The [`to_parallelize`]
function is called for each set of parameters in [`param_list`]
.

5. The results of the parallelized operations are stored in the [`results`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolInFile?%5B%22work%2Fparallel_scikit.py%22%2C%22results%22%5D "work/parallel_scikit.py") list and returned by the function.

This function is a good example of how to use parallel computing to speed up computationally intensive tasks such as hyperparameter tuning in machine learning.
